Have you used DI before ?in any technology ?



A developer creates lots of objects in an application

	But does developer writes any code to destroy the object?


A controller is also a class

	-----------------------------------------------------------

	1. A developer will not create any object now on
	2. Objects will be created and destroyed by runtime

	------------------------------------

	Di is applied in 2 steps
	a. Useing a contructor in controller/(anywhere u need any object)
	b. In program.cs - add class as a service, and tell runtime when to destroy the object
			This is where a devlopers expertise comes in
			as this is also concerned about shareing the object between multiple requests

			There are 3 methods 
			1. Transcient - PerCall - runtime will create and destroy object for every call
				use this when data is much dynamic - eg. Stockmarket - currency rate - cricket score
			2. Scoped    - PerUser - runtime will create and destroy object for every user
				use this when data is private/personal to a user - eg. Bankaccount
			3. Singleton  - PerApplication - runtime will create and destroy object once
				user this when data is much static - eg. FlightSchedule - Railway schedule
